# Mum Loves Representation
Mum Loves Representation is a blog by an African British Mum(Tomi) who wants her little girl to be able to play with a heirloom doll that represents her as she grows and plays imaginatively. She believes that all children should play with black dolls for the purpose of encouraging diversity. She feels that  brown dolls, black dolls, and ethnic dolls are often left upon the shelf, untouched and ignored while it is easy to get one's hands-on white dolls. She believes the situation is very tragic.This blog features several Articles posted by Tomi that shed more light on this issue along with several other topics under the ethnicity topic.

![Responsive Mockup]()

The Responsive Mockup image above shows how responsive the Mum Loves Representation is across various device screen sizes ranging from mobile devices to large monitor screens. The Mum Loves Representation is well layed out with a bold font style used across all pages. The buttons are very legible on all the screen sizes. 

## UX

### Colour Scheme Used
I chose to go with this Boostrap blog theme called Clean Blog. It features a modern design with a subtle splash of color. This makes the site very easy to read with large fonts that are well spaced out. I made use of specifically choosen background images to showcase the theme of the blog. 

### Typography

I chose to use this carefully styled Bootstrap blog theme which features distraction free blog text optimized for legibility. It uses the Lora font-family for the body and the Open Sans font-family for the headers.

## Features

  - It is made up of five links including the logo.

  - At the very bottom of the home page and every other page on the MLR website is the footer which houses the relevant social media links. 
  -  When clicked on, these social media links open to a new tab preventing the user from having to use the back button to go back to the page they were on before.
